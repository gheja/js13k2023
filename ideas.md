# general
map with about 15 cities.
starting from Europe
have to explore Asia
a king requires your help with mapping Asia, while delivering his message to one of the cities

map shows the cities and dotted lines connecting them. also the character with an arrow or line that points to its heading.

there is a dial/compass on the left for the character's heading, can be controlled by the player (touch and A-D) but has an offset to divert the player from the intended direction.

there is also a mini game on the right. when playing it correctly nothing happens (optional: only after the player finishes it perfecty? extra boost maybe?), but if misses the divert gets a random value to nudge the character off the intended path. controls: touch and J-K, J-K-L, H-J-K-L

  * you: ...
  * king: you look brave! you look fierce! what could go wrong? haha!

# cities, rumors, artifacts

city menu:
  * collect the welcome gifts - x gold, once per run, increases with each city visited (multiple runs)
  * deliver the message of the king - only in specified city
  * try to find the artifact - locked and masked by "[locked]" for the first run, shows the chance, one try per run, not available in easy mode?

each city has an artifact, that can only be obtained by chance (1d20). it is locked on the first run. the chances can be improved by having more clues/rumors.
  * no rumor: 1/20
  * one rumor (name of the artifact): 5/20
  * two rumors (location): 10/20
  * three rumors (name of the bearer): 18/20

the rumors must be unlocked by gold. each level costs much more. player can only select the level which the rumor is at, it unlocks randomly but only for those artifacts that have the rumor below unlocked. extra rumors for extra cities?

artifacts:
  * speed boost
  * accuracy boost
  * income boost
  * city income boost
